<h2>Welcome to the Season of Nesting! </h2>
<h3><strong><em>‚Äú It's time to make the Realms your home as you decorate your very own Nest in Aviary Village üè† ‚Äù </em></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left">Sky Kids are a creative bunch, and the doors are about to open to a Season made just for that creativity! Head to the newly opened <strong>Nesting Workshop </strong>in Aviary Village, where the <strong>Nesting Guide</strong> awaits you. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">Talk to them to complete Seasonal Quests and unlock your very own Nest in a newly constructed area of the village. This cozy spot will be yours to design however you like, whether your aim is a relaxing nook, chaotic arthouse, or anything in between. Special display stands inside the Nesting Workshop offer new Seasonal cosmetics, with items including a large volume of wood-crafted Props. In addition, a rotating selection of over 50 stone-made furniture and decor has also been added to the workshop as a permanent addition. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">With so many new offerings to use in your Nest, this Season offers all kinds of room for creative expression. The Nesting Guide, fellow Sky Kids, and your imagination are inviting you to build something that is uniquely yours. </p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">What's new in this Season?</h3>
<ul>
  <li><h4 style="text-align: left">Nesting Workshop</h4>
	  <p style="text-align: left">The Season of Nesting further expanded upon Aviary Village by bringing a brand-new workshop full of cozy decorations and a place for Sky Kids to call home. The Nesting Guide can be found in the Shop opposite to the Hair Salon in Aviary Village, called the<em> Nesting Workshop.</em> As players complete Quests, they unlock their very own Nest to personalize, alongside shops and new features to inspire creative expression.</p>
	</li>
  <li><h4 style="text-align: left">Nest</h4></li>
	  <p style="text-align: left">It also brought<em> Nests,</em> a personal space that can be customized with Props, which can be found in a newly constructed building to the left of the Revival Cosmetics Shop and is unlocked during the second Seasonal Quest. <br>
  This cozy, apartment-like space features several windows that peer out into a cloudy landscape, allowing players to enjoy the same atmospheric lighting seen in Aviary Village. The special Shared Space Shrine that's used to decorate the <em>Nest </em>also features privacy settings that allow players to welcome friends inside for a visit or enjoy a quiet break in private mode.</p>
  <li><h4 style="text-align: left">Nesting Challenges</h4></li>
	  <p style="text-align: left"><em>Nesting Challenges</em> are a permanent addition to Sky and can be accessed once you start the third Seasonal Quest. There are three categories of challenges displayed on a board in the <em>Nesting Workshop,</em> each with their own Friendship Tree. Once all challenges in a Tree are completed, a unique interactive item becomes available to unlock for in-game currency.

Some challenges are focused on the player's Nest, while others can be done out in the Realms. These are entirely separate from the Season, so they can be completed over time as you play the game in your style and on your own schedule! For more information on the different challenges and rewards offered by the Challenge Board, see the Nesting Workshop page.</p>
